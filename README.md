# GrimoireLab Tutorial

[GrimoireLab](http://grimoirelab.github.io/), a
[CHAOSS](http://chaoss.community) project, is free, open source software for
software development analytics. It allows you to retrieve data from many kinds
of systems with information related to software development, and produce
analysis and visualizations with it.

GrimoireLab supports more than 20 different kinds of [data
sources](https://gitlab.com/Bitergia/c/FAQ/tree/master/sources#supported-data-sources),
from git repositories or GitHub projects, to issue trackers such as Jira or
Bugzilla, including messaging systems such as IRC, Slack or mailing lists, or
other types of systems such as StackOverflow or Jenkins. 

With the tools in the GrimoireLab toolset you can retrieve data, store it in
databases, analyze it, and produce nice dashboards for interactively visualizing
the resulting information.
