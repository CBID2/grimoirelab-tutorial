# How to remove a profile

Every profile in the `Individuals` table will have a "More options" icon which
opens up a dropdown with several options, including **Delete profile**. Clicking
on "Delete profile" will open a pop-up where you'll have to confirm that you
really want to delete this profile. If yes, press **Confirm**. This will remove
the said individual from SortingHat.

In the case several profiles need to be removed, they can be selected and
deleted in batches using the "Delete" button. To select a profile, click on the
profile once. A dark blue strip will appear on the left side of the profile tab.
That is the indicator that a profile is selected.
