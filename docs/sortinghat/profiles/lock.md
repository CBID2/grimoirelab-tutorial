# Lock a profile

SortingHat provides the ability to lock a profile. That is, no merge/delete/edit
can be acccomplish with that particular profile. It is basically blacklisted
from any SortingHat actions. In order to lock a profile, simply hover right next
to the profile name and a bunch of icons should appear. Click on the lock icon
to lock the profile.

Note: _Profile can be unlocked by clicking on the lock icon again_
