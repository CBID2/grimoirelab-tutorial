# Getting Started

GrimoireLab is a set of tools, and to ease the trouble with installation we are
providing a default setup to analyze Git activity for the grimoirelab
repository. In order to have this default setup running, follow the [setup
grimoirelab]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/getting-started/setup.md %})
section.

In case you want to configure grimoirelab to include your own data source, refer
to [How to add a data source]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
docs/data-sources/add-configurations.md %}).
