# Identify how effective community is at adressing issues from community participants

The goal of this area is to identify how effective the community is at
addressing issues from community participants. For example,

- What is the number of new issues created during a certain period ?
- What is the count of issues that showed activity during a certain period ?
- What is the count of issues that were closed during a certain period ?
- What is the average time that open issues have been open ?
- What is the time period between the opening of an issue and a response in the issue
  thread from another contributor ?
- How much time taken to close an issue ?
