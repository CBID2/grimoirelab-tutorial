# Understand the types and frequency of activities involved in developing code

The goal of this area is to identify and understand the source code changes over
time and the frequency of those changes over time. For example,

- What changes were made to the source code during a specified period ?
- How projects manage lifecycle of their version control branches ?
- What is the sum of the number of lines touches( lines addes plus lines removed
  ) in all changes to the source code during a certain period. ?
