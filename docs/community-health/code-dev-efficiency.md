# Understand how efficiently activities around code development get resolved.

The goal of this area is to identify how efficiently any code related activity
get resolved. For example,

- What is the time taken to merge a change request ?
- How many change requests are present in a code change ?
- What reviews of change requests ended up being declined during a certain
  period ?
- What is the ratio of change request accepted to rejected ?
