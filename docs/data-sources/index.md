# Data Sources

A data source in GrimoireLab refers to a platform (GitHub, Slack, Dockerhub
etc...) from where GrimoireLab can collect data in order to provide you with a
holistic picture of software development projects. Currently GrimoireLab
supports **30+ different sources** and it keeps on increasing.

In order to connect the data source of your choice to GrimoireLab, first check
whether it is [supported in GrimoireLab]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
docs/data-sources/supported.md %}).
