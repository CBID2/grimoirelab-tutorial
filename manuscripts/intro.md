# Reporting with Manuscripts

[Manuscripts](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-manuscripts) is the GrimoireLab tool to produce reports. It uses data from GrimoireLab indexes in ElasticSearch, and produces PDF documents with charts and tables, useful for getting an idea of how the project is performing.
