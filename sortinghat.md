# SortingHat

We already [built an index with SortingHat support](/grimoireelk/a-dashboard-with-sortinghat.md), and produced a dashboard showing it. But still there is a lot of SortingHat to learn, if we want to use all of its capacities. In this chapter we will learn how to use SortingHat in combination to other GrimoireLab tools (mainly Perceval and `p2o.py`). For a more complete guide to SortingHat, read the [SortingHat README](https://github.com/grimoirelab/sortinghat/blob/master/README.md).
