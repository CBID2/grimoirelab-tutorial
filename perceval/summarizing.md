## Summarizing

In this chapter we learned to install Perceval in a Python virtual environment, and then explored how to use it with several of the data sources it supports. For each of them, we learned how to use the standalone `perceval` script, which is a good test for fetching and showing data from each of the repositories of interest. We also learned how to write Python programs using the perceval Python module.

Now we have all the knowledge needed for the first step towards the analysis of data from software development repositories: data retrieval. We're ready for serious stuff...
